![GenVox Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Powered-blueviolet?style=flat&logo=python)  
GenVox a voice-activated multimodal generative Al companion could combine the latest advancements in natural language processing, image generation, and audio synthesis to deliver a highly interactive and versatile experience and it is a virtual Al companion that interacts seamlessly with users through voice commands and produces outputs in multiple formats, such as text, images and audio. It could serve as a personal assistant, creative collaborator, or learning partner, leveraging generative Al to adapt to the user's needs.

The project includes core features like voice-controlled text generation like storytelling, content creation, Q&A, and summarization via voice commands. Image creation via voice prompts like generate art, illustrations, or designs based on spoken descriptions. Audio Synthesis content.

Interactive Cross-Modal Content Creation Combine models based on vocal input, such as describing a text, image and ete. By using the technologies like large language models (LLM's) for the content creation and gTTs enterprise for the text to speech conversion, pyttxx3 for the natural language processing, python 3.0 for the project development and python Kivy for android development, API keys of Together ai, hugging face for using of prebuilt generative models. This project would let users activate and interact with various generative Al models through natural voice commands, making content creation intuitive and accessible.
